# KeyLock
A project for Cutie Hack 2017

## How it Works
KeyLock measures a user's 'typing cadence' that they exhibit when typing a password, in addition to a password for 
increased security.  
  
To work, a user must calibrate the program by typing in their password many times.  
  
KeyLock works though measuring the timings between keystrokes and performing a series of simple calculations, mainly 
averages to determine the maximum amount of deviation that is allowed.    

The "strictness" of the program is based on a user's calibration.  If the user was very consistent when calibrating, 
but are not today, then there may be issues.    

Additionally, the program does have a maximum amount of errors, which can be changed, which will make it easier for 
less consistent users.


## Application
KeyLock can be user for everything that requires a password, but will not allow 
autofill.
